Controls Assesment

<h2><b>Administrative Controls</b></h2>

<b>Least Privilege</b>: Needs to be implemented; High priority 
  Preventative; reduces risk by making sure vendors and non-authorized staff only have access to the assets/data they need to do their jobs


<b>Disaster recovery plans</b>: Needs to be implemented; High priority 
Corrective; business continuity to ensure systems are able to run in the event of an incident/there is limited to no loss of productivity downtime/impact to system components

<b>Password policies</b>: Need to be implemented; High priority 
Preventative; establish password strength rules to improve security/reduce likelihood of account compromise through brute force or dictionary attack techniques

<b>Access control policies</b>: Needs to be implemented: High priority 
Preventative; increase confidentiality and integrity of data

Deterrent; reduce attack surface/impact of physical threats

<b>Adequate lighting</b>: :Needs to be implemented: Med/low priority
Deterrent; limit “hiding” places to deter threats

<b>Closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance</b>: Needs to be implemented: High/Med priority
