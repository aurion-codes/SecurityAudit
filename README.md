<h2><b>Administrative Controls</b></h2>

<b>Least Privilege</b>: Needs to be implemented; High priority 
  Preventative; reduces risk by making sure vendors and non-authorized staff only have access to the assets/data they need to do their jobs


<b>Disaster recovery plans</b>: Needs to be implemented; High priority 
Corrective; business continuity to ensure systems are able to run in the event of an incident/there is limited to no loss of productivity downtime/impact to system components, including: computer room environment (air conditioning, power supply, etc.); hardware (servers, employee equipment); connectivity (internal network, wireless); applications (email, electronic data); data and restoration
